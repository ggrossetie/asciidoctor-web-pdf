Part way through the document, the blocks stop rendering correctly. What went wrong?::

//tag::answer[]
When content is not rendered as you expect in the later part of a document, it's usually due to a delimited block missing its closing delimiter line.
The most devious culprit is the <<user-manual#open-blocks,open block>>.
An open block doesn't have any special styling, but its contents have the same restrictions as other delimited blocks, i.e. it can not contain section titles.

To solve this problem, first look for missing delimiter lines.
<<user-manual#text-editor,Syntax highlighting in your text editor>> can help with this.
Also look at the rendered output to see if the block styles are extending past where you intended.
When working with open blocks, you may need to add custom styles (such as a red border) to the class openblock so you can see its boundaries.
