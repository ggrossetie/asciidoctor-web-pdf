To use Asciidoctor in your application, you first need to require the gem:

[source,ruby]
require 'asciidoctor'

This statement makes all of the https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/asciidoctor/Asciidoctor[public APIs in Asciidoctor] available to your script or application.
You are now ready to start processing AsciiDoc documents.

The main entry points in the Asciidoctor API are the static methods to load or convert AsciiDoc documents, which we'll cover the next two chapters.
