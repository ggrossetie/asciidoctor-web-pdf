The bulk of the content in a document is paragraph text.
This is why Asciidoctor doesn't require any special markup or attributes to specify paragraph content.
You can just start typing.

In Asciidoctor, adjacent or consecutive lines of text form a paragraph element.
To start a new paragraph after another element, such as a section title or table, hit the kbd:[RETURN] key twice to insert a blank line, and then continue typing your content.
