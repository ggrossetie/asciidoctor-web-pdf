XML doesn't have line comments, so our "`tuck the callout behind a line comment`" trick doesn't work here.
To use callouts in XML, you must place the callout's angled brackets around the the XML comment and callout number.

Here's how it appears in a listing:

[source,subs=specialcharacters]
....
include::ex-callout.adoc[tag=source-xml]
....

Here's how it looks when rendered:

====
include::ex-callout.adoc[tag=source-xml]
====

Notice the comment has been replaced with a circled number that cannot be selected (if not using font icons it will be
rendered differently and selectable).
Now both you and the reader can copy and paste XML source code containing callouts without worrying about errors.
