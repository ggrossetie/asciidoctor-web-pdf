- user-manual: Static website generators: Configuring attributes for Awestruct
////

Awestruct defines a set of default attributes that it passes to the API in its [.path]_/default-site.yml_ file.
One of the attributes in that configuration is `imagesdir`.
The value there is set to [.path]_/images_.
That means the value in your document is skipped due to the precedence rules.

Fortunately, there is one additional place you can override the attribute.
This gives you the opportunity to set your own default and to flip the precedence order so that the document wins out.
If an attribute value that is passed to the API ends with an `@` symbol, it makes that assignment have a lower precedence than an assignment in the document.

You can define attributes you want to pass to the API in the [.path]__config/site.yml_ file.
Here's an example entry for Asciidoctor:

```yaml
asciidoctor:
  :safe: safe
  :attributes:
    imagesdir: /assets/images@
    icons: font
    ...
```

NOTE: The second-level keys (safe and attributes, in this case) must have colons on both sides of the key name.
The rest of the keys only have a colon after the key.

With this configuration added, you should observe that the `imagesdir` attribute in your document is now respected.
