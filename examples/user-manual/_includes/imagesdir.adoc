The path to the location of images is controlled by the `imagesdir` document attribute.
The value of this attribute (empty by default) is added to the beginning of _every_ image target.
Therefore, you never need to reference this attribute.
You only need to set it.

.Incorrect
[source,asciidoc]
----
image::{imagesdir}/name-of-image.png[]
----

.Correct
[source,asciidoc]
----
image::name-of-image.png[]
----

The resolved location of the image will be: <imagesdir> + <target>.

The benefit of the processor adding the value of the `imagesdir` attribute the the start of all image targets is that you can globally control the folder where images are located per converter.
We refer to this folder as the image catalog.
Since different output formats require the images to be in different locations, this attribute makes it possible to accomodate many different scenarios.

We recommend relying on the imagesdir attribute when defining the target of your image to avoid hard-coding that common path in every single image macro.
Always think about where the image is relative to the image catalog.

The imagesdir attribute value can be an absolute path, relative path or URI.
By default, the value of the imagesdir attribute is empty, which means these images are resolved relative to the document.
If the image target is an absolute path or URI, the imagesdir prefix is _not_ added to the path.

TIP: You can set the imagesdir attribute in multiple places in your document, as long as it is not locked by the API.
This technique is useful if you store images for different parts, chapters, or sections of your document in different locations.
