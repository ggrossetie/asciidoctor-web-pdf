This PDF generating demo is about creating resumes. Two versions of a sample resume written in ASCIIDOC are
generated, a 

1. _continguous_ ; and a
1. _paged_

version. While the content is naturally the same, the layout differs slightly. Most notable, while the continguous 
resume has only a footer at the end of the document the paged version has
- a footer on each page (aka a _running footer_),
- printing marks
- printing margins
- running page number (along with total number of pages) in footer.

In essence, this demo shows you how to generate a paged PDF in combination with a customized rendering.

The continguous resume is generated by invoking `asciidoctor-web-pdf` as shown below using the command-line:

```console
$ asciidoctor-web-pdf resume.adoc --template-require ./template.js
```

Use `resume-paged.js` create a _paged resume_. Notice that `resume-paged.js` depends on `resume-paged.css` while `template.js` uses `style.css`:

```console
$ asciidoctor-web-pdf resume.adoc --template-require ./resume-paged.js -o resume-paged.pdf
```
